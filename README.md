## AWS Media Services Tools

A library of scripts for interacting with AWS Media Services and documentation for working with compatible contribution encoders.


## Contents
#### Library of  scripts for interacting with AWS Media Services:

Each AWS Media Service has a sub-directory, inside it, you'll find scripts for starting and stopping the service written in Python 3.7 and formatted to either run locally or as AWS Lambda functions. You'll also find documentation on what inputs these scripts expect, what outputs they deliver, and examples for using them in conjunction.  
- MediaConnect [scripts](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-media-services-tools/tree/master/MediaConnect/Compatibility/Examples)
- MediaLive [scripts](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-media-services-tools/tree/master/MediaLive/Compatibility/Examples)
- MediaPackage [scripts](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-media-services-tools/tree/master/MediaPackage/Compatibility/Examples)


#### Compatibility documentation:

Each AWS Media Service directory has a Compatibility sub-directory, inside you'll find further sub-directories for partner companies and products that we have confirmed are compatible with that AWS Media Service.  To the best of our ability we attempt to provide comprehensive documentation for reproducing our compatibility testing. This includes example configurations, links to detailed documentation, and scripts for starting the products.   
Please see the AWS Media Service Compatibility [website](https://aws.amazon.com/media-services/compatibility/#) for full details on the compatibility program and how to become a compatibility partner.
